If you do anything before week 1 please be sure to get your system up and running! Before beginning work in this course you are required to set up __Python 3 with Jupyter notebooks__. If you do not yet have this set up in your working environment then please follow with one of the options in section 1.2."

These allow developers to explore programming with objects held persistently in memory. Python was the flagship language for Jupyter (nee IPython), and has grown around an extensive suite of modules for analysis and visualization. These together with Jupyter make for an excellent suite of tools for exploratory data analysis and data-driven report generation. These lecture notes are being presented as a Jupyter Notebook."

These differ across operating systems and also might require some setup. Even though we won't be using command line utilities much in this course, and even if you're going to use Anaconda, it's still a good idea to get your working enviornment set up with some helpful command line tools, but its ok if this takes a bit more time to gel. Even though we're working in Jupyter notebooks to learn, explore, share, and prototyle for data science, its still generally best to deploy code in scripts and using bash/shell commands from a command line. \n",
